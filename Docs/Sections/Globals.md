**SKTiled** globals are accessible via the [`TiledGlobals`][tiledglobals-url] object. This structure enables the user to set default values for various API objects, as well as enable/disable debugging functions.


```swift
// Access the default `TiledGlobals` singleton
let globals = TiledGlobals.default
```
